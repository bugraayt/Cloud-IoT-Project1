To support 1000 IoT devices and 300 clients, the system requires Azure IoT Hub for device communication, Azure Functions for serverless data processing, Cosmos DB for telemetry storage, and optionally Azure App Service for the front-end dashboard. I calculated the estimated monthly cost using the Azure Pricing Calculator. While costs may vary depending on message frequency, retention policies, and region selection, this calculation provides a realistic basis for operating a Smart Home IoT platform at scale.
